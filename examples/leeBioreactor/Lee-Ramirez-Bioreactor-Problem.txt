% the same spirit as the Simple Public License, the language       %
% implementation the GPOPS License is similar to that of GPL 2.0.  %
% The words are different, but the goal is the same - to guarantee %
% for all users the freedom to share and change software.  If      %
% anyone wonders about the meaning of the GPOPS License, they      %
% should interpret it as consistent with GPL 2.0.                  %

%       (that is zero if you did not pay anything). You may not    %
%       recover any other damages, including those called          %
%       "consequential damages." (The state or country where you   %
%       live may not allow you to limit your liability in this     %

%     * Anyone prevents you from distributing the software under   %
%       the terms of the SimPL.                                    %
